    <h2>Origin Story</h2>
    
    <p>When I was a teenager I attended this fancy magnate school for health and bioscience. It was brand new, I was in the third ever graduating class. I graduated elligable to take the CNA licensing exam for my state, I had done clinical hours in a real care home, and I thought that's what I was passionate for. 16 year old me thought that I would be a nurse or a doctor, or a pharmacist, but after a few years, I realized something very important; Every single person I met was having the worst time of their life.</p>
    <p>That was impactful for me. The job became depressing and overwhelming. So I quit. I moved on, I changed. I became an artist. And now, in college, I'm becoming a designer. I learned the value of change and personal evolution, and I'm hoping to keep learning while I pursue a career here.</p>
